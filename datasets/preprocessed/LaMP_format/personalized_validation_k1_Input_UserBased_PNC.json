If Clinton does pull out a win, it ends Sanders' streak and all but guarantees Clinton's nomination. If, on the other hand, Sanders should narrowly win, it doesn't mean he wins the nomination -- the two will split New York's delegates almost evenly. His path to a delegate majority would still be exceedingly steep. But a Sanders win, which would make eight out of the last nine, would reinforce the impression that he's the one with momentum.
